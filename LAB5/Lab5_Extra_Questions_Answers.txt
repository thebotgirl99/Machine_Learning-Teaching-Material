1.P(y = 1|x) is 0.46
Explanation: For a given input (example), the logistic regression model always provides an output specifying the probability of that example to occur (1). For eg, given an event x, the probability for the input to occur (p=1) is 0.46. Meaning, there is a less chance for X to occur.
