1. 34%  (this option was not available, hence those who attempted will get +1 mark)
Explanation: Correlation coefficient is r. 
r^2 is used to determine the accuracy/relationship of the model. 
Which implies, in percentage, r^2 is : (0.58*0.58)*100 = 34% 

2. by value of slope
Explanation: y = B0 + B1*x. 
Based on the value of B1, the value of y changes.

3. Because the outcome variable is nominal not continuous
Explanation: Nominal variables are those which are categorical in nature and are distinct. Linear regression always requires continuous numerical values.

4. -11
Explanation: 
residual = y - yhat
yhat = 35 + 0.72(105) = 110.6
residual = 99.6 - 110.6 = -11

5.strong positive correlation
Explanation: The scattered points lie almost in the same line and vary linearly with each other.The more the points are towards the diagonals of the graph, the weaker the plot.
